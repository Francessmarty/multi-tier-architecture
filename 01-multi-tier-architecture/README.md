### Project 1: VNet Multi Tier Architecture with Access Control

----

### Overview

In this project, I deployed a multi-tier architecture in Azure using Azure CLI scripts and version control in GitHub.

The goal:
	Create a segmented network (Web, App, DB)
	Deploy Linux VMs in each subnet
	Control traffic between them using NSGs
	Verify that only the correct communication is allowed
	Automate everything using Bash scripts

Everything was deployed using CLI. No manual resource creation in the Azure Portal.

### Architecture

### Network Setup

The environment includes:
	1 Virtual Network
	Subnets:
		1 Web subnet (10.10.1.0/24)
		1 App subnet (10.10.2.0/24)
		1 DB subnet (10.10.3.0/24)
    Each subnet has its own NSG attached.

    Virtual Machines:
		1 Linux VM in Web subnet
		1 Linux VM in App subnet
		1 Linux VM in DB subnet


----

### Access Control Design

Traffic is restricted intentionally:
	•	Web to App (port 8080): Allowed
	•	App to DB (port 5432): Allowed
	•	Web to DB: Blocked

This enforces proper tier separation.

The verification script confirms that these rules behave exactly as expected.

### What This Project Demonstrates

This project shows:
	•	How to create a segmented VNet with multiple subnets
	•	How to provision Linux VMs using Azure CLI
	•	How to enforce layered access control using NSGs
	•	How to verify connectivity rules between tiers
	•	How to automate deployment and cleanup using Bash scripts

----

### Scripts

All deployment steps are automated using Bash scripts.

	•	00-config.sh: Configuration variables
    •	01-deploy-network.sh: Creates VNet and subnets
	•	02-deploy-nsg.sh: Creates and configures NSGs
	•	03-deploy-vms.sh: Deploys Linux VMs
    •	04-deploy-all.sh: Runs full deployment
	•	05-verify.sh: Tests connectivity between tiers
	•	06-cleanup.sh: Deletes the resource group

There is also a deploy-all script to automate the full setup.

----

### How to Deploy

From Cloud Shell:
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
scripts/04-deploy-all.sh

---- 

### Verification

Expected results:
	•	WEB → APP = PASS
	•	WEB → DB = FAIL
	•	APP → DB = PASS

These results confirm that access control is working correctly.

Screenshots of all verification steps are included in the screenshots/ folder.

----

### Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources:
scripts/06-cleanup

This deletes the entire resource group to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

### Final Notes

This project focuses on:
	•	Network segmentation
	•	Enforced access control
	•	Scripted deployment
	•	Validation through connectivity testing
	•	Proper cleanup after use
