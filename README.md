#### Cloud Infrastructure & Automation: Capstone Project

This repository contains my capstone work demonstrating practical cloud engineering, containerization, infrastructure deployment and CI/CD automation using Microsoft Azure, Docker and GitHub Actions.

The capstone consists of two major projects, each focusing on different layers of modern cloud infrastructure.

#### Project 1: VNet-Based Multi-Tier Architecture (Infrastructure Focus)

#### Objective

Design and deploy a secure multi-tier architecture in Microsoft Azure using:
	•	Virtual Network (VNet)
	•	Subnets (Web, App, DB)
	•	Linux Virtual Machines
	•	Network Security Groups (NSGs)
	•	Controlled communication between tiers


----

#### Architecture Logic

Web VM to App VM to DB VM

Security rules enforced:
	•	Web to App:Allowed
	•	Web to DB: Blocked
	•	App to DB: Allowed

This demonstrated network segmentation and access control enforcement.

#### Key Skills Demonstrated
	•	Azure CLI scripting
	•	VNet and subnet configuration
	•	NSG rule configuration
	•	SSH verification
	•	Infrastructure automation via Bash scripts
	•	Cloud cost control and cleanup

----

##### Project 2: Dockerized 3 Tier Web Application with CI/CD
----
#### Objective

Design, containerize and deploy a 3-tier web application using Docker and GitHub CI/CD.

Application stack:
	•	Frontend: Nginx
	•	Backend: Node.js
	•	Database: MySQL

----

#### Application Architecture

User to Frontend (Nginx) to Backend (Node.js API) to MySQL Database

----

#### What Was Implemented
	•	Separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
	•	Multi service orchestration using Docker Compose
	•	Image version tagging (v2)
	•	Push to Docker Hub
	•	Deployment to Azure Linux VM
	•	Public exposure of frontend
	•	Internal backend verification
	•	Automated image build & push using GitHub Actions

----

#### CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
	•	Builds Docker images
	•	Tags images
	•	Pushes to Docker Hub

This ensures reproducible builds and automated container versioning.

----

#### Deployment & Verification

For both projects, screenshots are included demonstrating:
	•	Infrastructure provisioning
	•	Network rule enforcement
	•	Running containers
	•	Public web access
	•	Successful CI/CD pipeline execution

All cloud resources were cleaned up after validation to prevent unnecessary cost.

----

#### Technologies Used
	•	Microsoft Azure
	•	Azure CLI
	•	Linux (Ubuntu)
	•	Docker
	•	Docker Compose
	•	GitHub Actions
	•	MySQL
	•	Node.js
	•	Nginx

----

#### What This Capstone Demonstrates

This capstone showcases:
	•	Infrastructure provisioning and segmentation
	•	Secure multi tier network design
	•	Containerization best practices
	•	CI/CD automation
	•	Cloud VM deployment
	•	DevOps lifecycle management
	•	Responsible cloud cost governance

----

#### Outcome

Both projects were successfully implemented, verified and documented.

This repository demonstrates practical cloud engineering skills combining infrastructure, containerization and automation.
