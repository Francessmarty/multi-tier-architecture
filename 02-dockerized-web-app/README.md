#### Project 2: Dockerized 3 Tier Web Application with CI/CD

----

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design, containerization and deployment of a three tier web application using Docker and Docker Compose, deployed on a Linux Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure.

The application architecture consists of:
	•	Frontend: Nginx based web interface
	•	Backend: Node.js REST API
	•	Database: MySQL

The project also integrates with Docker Hub and includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

----

#### Architecture

User to Frontend (Nginx) to Backend (Node.js API) to Database (MySQL)

## Components

Layer	    Technology	Purpose
Frontend:	Nginx	Serves static content and proxies API calls
Backend:	Node.js	Handles API logic
Database:	MySQL	Stores application data


----

#### Containerization

Each service has its own Dockerfile:
	•	frontend/Dockerfile
	•	backend/Dockerfile

The services are orchestrated together using:

docker-compose.yml

Docker Compose handles:
	•	Service networking
	•	Port mapping
	•	Environment variables
	•	Dependency management

----


#### Docker Hub Images

Both images were built and pushed to Docker Hub with version tags:
	•	dockerized-web-app-frontend:v2
	•	dockerized-web-app-backend:v2

This allows reproducible deployments across environments.

----

#### Cloud Deployment

A Linux VM was provisioned in Microsoft Azure.

Deployment steps included:
	1.	SSH into the VM
	2.	Clone repository
	3.	Run:

docker compose up -d

	4.	Application exposed publicly via:

http://<VM_PUBLIC_IP>:8080

All services were verified running using:

docker ps


----


#### CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

A GitHub Actions workflow was implemented to:
	•	Build Docker images
	•	Tag images
	•	Push images to Docker Hub

This ensures automated builds on every commit to main.

----

#### Proof of Deployment

Screenshots included in the repository demonstrate:
	•	Docker containers running
	•	Public application access
	•	Docker Hub images
	•	GitHub Actions successful pipeline run

----

#### How to Run Locally

1. Clone repository

git clone <repo-url>
cd 02-dockerized-web-app

2. Build and run

docker compose up --build

3. Access application

http://localhost:8080


----

#### Key Skills Demonstrated
	•	Docker image creation
	•	Multi container orchestration
	•	Docker networking
	•	Cloud VM deployment
	•	CI/CD automation
	•	Container lifecycle management
	•	Version tagging strategy

----

#### Lessons Learned
	•	Importance of container isolation
	•	Networking between services inside Docker
	•	Cloud security group configuration
	•	Automated image versioning
	•	Deployment validation and cleanup

----

#### Cleanup

After verification and screenshot capture, the Azure VM and associated resources were deleted to prevent additional cloud costs.
